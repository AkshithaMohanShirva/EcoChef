EcoChef is a mobile app designed to reduce food waste and 
promote sustainable cooking. It helps users by recommending 
recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home, 
prioritizing items nearing expiration also provides personalized 
storage tips to extend the life of foods, minimizing waste. The app
offers meal planning, generates shopping lists, and integrates 
eco-conscious options to promote a sustainable lifestyle. With 
features like smart notifications, food waste tracking, and 
community challenges, EcoChef encourages users to cook 
smarter, save money, and make eco-friendly choices in the 
kitchen. We can also add a Food Donation Integration to the app 
which will suggest local food donation programs or food banks in 
that area, allowing people to donate directly through the app. 
Users could also customize their preferences with detailed filters 
for dietary restrictions, allergies, and food preferences, ensuring 
that all recipe suggestions align with their personal or health 
needs.
